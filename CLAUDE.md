# PM & Tech Rehaul — Victoria 3 mod

An **economic-realism mod for Victoria 3 (1.13 "Matcha")** that addresses structural
deficiencies in the base game's economy.

## Why this mod exists (the goals)

The vanilla economy is too forgiving and makes technology feel cheap. Concretely:

- **A technological edge should really matter.** Falling behind on tech should cost you
  markets; leading should let you out-compete rivals. Vanilla blunts this.
- **The economy should be more competitive and aggressive** — efficient producers should
  drive inefficient ones out of a market, not coexist indefinitely.
- **Upgrading production should cost capital, like it does in reality.** Today, turning an
  1830s-design factory into a 1930s-design one is *free* — you just flip a production method.
  That is ridiculous. A more modern, more efficient plant should have to be **built** (real
  construction cost, real capital demand), not switched on for nothing. This raises the demand
  for capital and creates a realistic capital deficit as economies modernize.

Everything below — "one main PM", "a building per tier", the profitability ladder — is a
**means to those ends**, not the point. If a mechanic doesn't serve the goals above, it's wrong.

## How the goals are achieved (the means)

1. **One main PM per building.** Each economic building keeps a single main production method.
   The old free "switch your factory to a newer method" upgrade path is removed. Secondary /
   redistribution groups (automation, luxury, canning, distillery, glassblowing, …) stay.
2. **A building per tier.** Each former main PM becomes its own building type, unlocked on the
   same technology the old PM used. Modernizing now means *constructing* the newer building —
   spending capital — instead of a free toggle. (This is the mechanism for the capital-demand
   and "tech matters" goals.)
3. **Profitability ladder.** Outputs/inputs are re-sloped so a tier-N building can't stay
   profitable once tier-(N+2) buildings flood the market — so a tech lead actually pushes
   laggards out. Governed by a break-even ladder in `BALANCE_FRAMEWORK.md` (the balance
   source of truth).

Scope now: **all manufacturing + the new-economy chains + the art academy** — 22 config industries / 67 tier
buildings. The new-economy chains (infra + electricity) are `power` (electricity, **on the BE ladder**), `port`
and `railway` (both `follows_be: false` — kept on **vanilla economics**, informational BE only). They
live in other vanilla files (`06_urban_center`, `11_private_infrastructure`) and are emitted by
**clone-and-swap** (see below); `trade_center` is deliberately left vanilla. **`art_academy`** (fine_art,
`bg_arts`, on the BE ladder) is a normal split (not clone) sourced from `06_urban_center`; its 4 tiers are the
vanilla base PMs (traditional → realist → photographic → film art). Its jobs live in its **ownership PMG**
(kept as a secondary), so its tiers carry **no base `employment`** — the builder omits the empty `level_scaled`
block, and the UI's workforce column counts every secondary PMG's active PM (base included) so the jobs still show. Break-even is
**wage-inclusive** (full break-even: output revenue = input goods + wages, wages = `wage_pct`·input cost,
default 33% — a model-only accounting layer, **not** emitted to the game; see BALANCE_FRAMEWORK §1).
**The ladder is a curve over each tier's tech unlock date (era), not a per-industry group ladder.** Each
tier's `target_be` = the era anchor for its unlocking tech's era, minus an early-game input adjustment:
- **Era anchors** (BE % of base output price), by the tech's vanilla era: **e1 125 / e2 100 / e3 75 /
  e4 50 / e5 35** (~25 pp/era, so a 2-era lead sits ~50 pp under → the N+2 obsolescence). There is
  **no within-era differentiation** — every tier on the same era gets the same anchor (the eras will be
  reworked later).
- **H1 manufactured-input discount: −15 pp** if the tier unlocks in **eras 1–3** *and* its recipe
  consumes a **factory-made intermediate** (tools, steel, engines, fertilizer, explosives, paper, glass,
  …). **Dye and silk do NOT count** (RGO/plantation-sourced in H1; see BALANCE_FRAMEWORK §3). Off in
  eras 4–5, where those intermediate markets have matured to ~base.

Targets are derived by **`tools/solve_be_targets.ps1`** (reads each tech's era live from vanilla, writes
per-tier `target_be` + `natural_year`); the UI shows the natural unlock year per tier and per industry.
Volumes then follow the §8 methodology (tier-1 output = vanilla output, ×1.5 per tier, inputs solved from
the full-BE goal with wages folded in).
**Shipyards are enabled and split by output good** into two output-good-consistent 2-tier chains (the
vanilla shipyard produces *clippers* then switches to *steamers* mid-ladder): `shipyard` → clippers
(Basic/Complex, e1/e2 → 125/85) and `shipyard_steam` → steamers (Metal/Arc-Welding, e3/e5 → 60/35). The
steamer chain is all-new buildings (base `building_shipyard_metal`, no vanilla anchor — the builder
appends it). Deferred: more tech tiers, transport/electricity secondary-PM tweaks, and raw-resource
extraction. (The wage layer is now folded into the ladder.)

Only `mod/` is the game mod; the whole repo (docs + tools + config + `mod/`) goes on GitHub.
The deployed mod is a real copy of `mod/` only (see Deployment below), so docs/tools never reach
the game.

## Working conventions

- **Keep the docs in sync with reality — always, in the same pass as the change.** Any change
  that affects behavior, file structure, conventions, scope, or numbers must be reflected in the
  relevant `.md` (`CLAUDE.md`, `BALANCE_FRAMEWORK.md`, `MODDING_NOTES.md`, `ON_GAME_UPDATE.md`,
  `README.md`) right then. In particular, any new coupling to a vanilla file/number goes in
  `ON_GAME_UPDATE.md`.
  Never leave a doc describing something that is no longer true, and never leave a doc update
  "hanging" for later. **One narrow exception:** when a change is a *proposed* solution the user is
  still weighing and its outcome is genuinely uncertain, the doc update may be briefly deferred —
  but call out the divergence explicitly and reconcile it the moment it settles (bring the docs to
  the facts, or the facts to the docs). Resolve such gaps as soon as possible, not eventually.
- **Edit the config, not the generated files.** The mod content lives in
  `config/mod_config.json`. To change balance or add/split buildings, edit that, then run the
  builder:
  ```
  powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\build.ps1
  ```
  It regenerates every `mod/common/*` and `mod/localization/*` file, regenerates
  `tools/ladder_tiers.txt`, **converts the 1836 start** (re-tiers vanilla starting factories into
  `mod/common/history/buildings/` via `convert_history.ps1`), and then runs the linter — which
  must print **LINT PASSED** (BE-vs-ladder) and **NEGATIVE-GOODS CHECK PASSED** (invariant: no
  reachable PM combination drives any good's building-level total input/output below zero — see
  Working conventions), then **MOD CHECKS PASSED** (post-build sanity on the finished mod:
  required files exist + non-empty, one loc file per language — the hook for future mandatory
  checks lives in `Invoke-ModChecks` in `build.ps1`). Never hand-edit files under `mod/common` or
  `mod/localization`; they are overwritten on every build. To build from a **different config
  file** (e.g. an alternate balance set exported from the UI) without touching
  `config/mod_config.json`, pass `-Config <path>` — `build.ps1` threads it through the start
  extractor and history converter too, so the whole build uses that file. Default is
  `config/mod_config.json`. Other flags: `-NoLint`, `-NoDeploy`.
- **Build somewhere other than `mod/` (for tests / alternates).** By default the build writes the
  canonical `mod/` and deploys it. Two flags redirect the output and **never touch `mod/`** (nor
  `tools/ladder_tiers.txt`, `ui/data.js`, or `config/start_baseline.json` — alt builds only ever
  write their own folder):
    - `-DryRun` — build a full, real mod into a throwaway `mod_dryrun_<pid>/`, run the linter +
      `Invoke-ModChecks` on it, report, then **delete** the folder. Never deploys. Use this to
      verify a config/build safely (**prefer it for test builds** so a build never silently
      rewrites `mod/`).
    - `-SaveTo <name>` — build into `mod_<name>/` inside the repo and **keep** it (not deployed,
      not deleted; clean up manually). For alternate balance sets you want to compare/keep.
  `-DryRun` and `-SaveTo` are mutually exclusive.
- **The 1836 start is converted, not hand-authored.** `convert_history.ps1` reads vanilla
  `common/history/buildings/*.txt` and maps each split-industry factory (base building + active
  main PM) onto the correct tier building, keeping ownership + secondary PMs. metadata.json's
  `replace_paths` makes the mod's copy replace vanilla's, so **rebuild after any game update** to
  pick up new vanilla history. Uses the `vanilla_pm` field per tier in the config.
- **Manual start overrides** live in `config/start_exceptions.json`: rules targeting a vanilla base
  building, optionally scoped to a `country` (region_state tag) and/or `state`, with action
  `force_tier` (set tier N regardless of vanilla PM) or `remove` (delete the factory). Most
  specific scope wins. Default is an empty `rules` list (pure mechanical conversion). To author
  rules, browse `config/start_baseline.json` (regenerated each build by `extract_start.ps1`) to see
  which countries/states have which factories. That baseline's `unmapped` list is also the
  **version-drift alarm**: if a game update renames/adds main PMs, unmapped factories appear there,
  telling you to refresh the config's `vanilla_pm` fields.
- **Config holds ACTUAL volumes.** `inputs` and `output_qty` are the real per-throughput numbers
  the game uses; the builder emits them directly. `target_be` is the design goal (informational) and
  now means **full** break-even (output revenue = input goods + wages). The linter re-checks each
  building's actual full break-even (building-level: main PM + the base PM of every other PMG, plus
  wages = `wage_pct`·inputs) against its configured `target_be` (±6pp). This per-target check supports
  the date-based ladder (era anchors 125/100/75/50/35 with the H1 −15 pp input adjustment; targets set by
  `solve_be_targets.ps1`). `tools/ladder_tiers.txt` carries `pm tier target_be wage_pct`.
- **Negative-goods invariant (second linter).** `tools/lint_negative_goods.awk` (run by `lint.sh` after
  the BE check) enforces that **no reachable combination of PMs drives any good's building-level total
  input or output below zero** — across **EVERY building** (vanilla + mod). Reduction PMs legitimately emit
  negative `goods_output_*_add` (e.g. the aeroplane/tank lines subtract from a car plant's automobiles
  output; luxury/ceramics/rayon PMs subtract from the base good); the design guarantees the active main
  output covers the maximum reduction. Because the balance UI lets any PM's goods be edited via `pm_goods`
  (**negatives allowed**, for those reduction outputs), this check catches an edit — or a tier-volume choice
  — that would let a player-selectable combination go negative. Method: **brute-force** the Cartesian
  product of each building's PMGs (one active PM per PMG — counts are tiny), keep only **legal**
  combinations, sum every good, and flag any total `< 0`. **Gating is respected** — a combination is legal
  only if every chosen PM's `unlocking_production_methods` gate is satisfied by another chosen PM in that
  same combination, so a gated secondary (e.g. `pm_elastics`, unlocked only by the sewing/electric main PMs)
  is never counted against a main PM that can't run it, and a vanilla base PMG's low-tier main PM isn't
  blamed for a reduction it can't reach. Only "risky" goods (those with a negative contribution in some PM)
  are checked, so buildings without reductions are skipped outright. **PM names are not all `pm_`-prefixed**
  (plantations/farms use `default_`/`automatic_`/`worker_`/… ), so every top-level block in a
  production_methods file is a PM and every token in a `production_methods`/`unlocking_production_methods`
  list is a PM reference. The check reads all vanilla PMGs, the mod's **owned** production-methods files (so
  `pm_goods` overrides are seen), and all buildings (vanilla + mod, mod overriding).
- **BE targets are derived from tech unlock date.** `tools/solve_be_targets.ps1` reads each tier's
  unlocking tech's **era** live from vanilla `common/technology/technologies/*.txt` and writes per-tier
  `target_be` (era anchor − H1 input discount, above) and `natural_year` (the era's representative year,
  shown in the UI). Run it **before** `solve_volumes.ps1` when eras/anchors change or after a game patch:
  `solve_be_targets.ps1` → `solve_volumes.ps1` → `solve_building_cost.ps1` → `build.ps1`. It is a
  design-target solver, not run by `build.ps1`.
- **Volumes are derived, not hand-tuned.** `output_qty`/`inputs` come from `tools/solve_volumes.ps1`
  (BALANCE_FRAMEWORK §8): tier-1 output = the vanilla tier-1 PM's output, higher tiers ×`output_mult`
  (default 1.5) per tier, inputs solved from `target_be` (with wages folded in: `I = target_be/100 ·
  O / (1+wage_pct)`) keeping vanilla input ratios. It re-reads the
  **current** vanilla recipes (via each tier's `vanilla_pm`), so after changing a `target_be`/`output_mult`
  or after a game update: run `solve_volumes.ps1`, then `build.ps1`. (The UI edits volumes directly;
  the solver regenerates them from the methodology.)
- **Building cost is derived too.** Each tier's `building_cost` (construction points) is emitted as the
  building's `required_construction` (a per-tier number now — it replaces vanilla's flat
  `construction_cost_high`/`_very_high` script-values; the building-level `required_construction` in the
  config remains only as a fallback for tiers without `building_cost`). Values come from
  `tools/solve_building_cost.ps1` — a 10-year-payback model (BALANCE_FRAMEWORK §9): `building_cost =
  10yr × 52wk × (20% net return on total operating cost) ÷ £720-per-construction-point`, where £720 is
  read live from the construction sector's iron PM at 0 efficiency bonus. Re-solve after changing volumes
  or a game patch: `solve_volumes.ps1` → `solve_building_cost.ps1` → `build.ps1`. The model's knobs
  (margin %, payback years, weeks/yr) are solver parameters; **wages** use the shared `wage_pct` (default
  0.33, per-tier `wage_pct` override — the same knob the volume solver, linter, and UI use; §1). The UI
  preserves `building_cost` through export/Build-now (it deep-clones the config), but does not itself edit it.
- **Toggle a whole industry** with an industry-level `disabled: true` in the config — the builder,
  history converter, and UI all skip it, leaving that vanilla building untouched (the mechanism that
  formerly kept shipyards vanilla; no industry is disabled now). Building-level flags: `heavy_industry_law` (emits the industry-ban /
  extraction-economy `possible` block), `coastal_only` (emits `potential = { is_coastal = yes }`),
  and a per-tier `output_good` override (e.g. clippers→steamers). `mod_config.json` is stored
  **minified**; edit it via the balance UI, or with JSON-aware tooling (add industries by merging
  with PowerShell `ConvertTo-Json -Compress`), not by hand.
- **New-economy industries (clone-and-swap) — power / port / railway.** These vanilla buildings carry
  engine-critical fields our simple schema can't model (`port = yes`, `terrain_manipulator`, big
  `ai_value`/`should_auto_expand` blocks, `potential`). So an industry with **`clone_from_vanilla: true`**
  is emitted by *copying its vanilla building block* and surgically swapping only key / tech / PMGs /
  (construction) — everything else verbatim (`New-ClonedBuilding` in build.ps1). It also needs
  **`source_file`** (the vanilla `common/buildings/*.txt` we whole-file-own for it — `06_urban_center` for
  power, `11_private_infrastructure` for port/railway; the builder now owns **01 + 06 + 11**). Two more
  industry flags: **`follows_be: false`** (port/railway — stay on vanilla volumes: the volume / BE-target /
  building-cost solvers skip them, the linter ladder skips them, the building name omits the BE target) and
  **`no_mass_be: true`** (all three — excluded from the linter ladder and, in the UI, locked-by-default so
  the mass BE tools + preset never touch them). Per-tier **`state_infrastructure`** is emitted as a
  workforce-scaled `state_infrastructure_add` (ports/railways produce infrastructure). Power is on the BE
  ladder normally (electricity output; `output_override` keeps its vanilla per-tier electricity). Their PMs
  are our own copies (editable), so `solve_volumes` reads **every** `common/production_methods` file, not
  just `01_industry`. `trade_center` stays vanilla (no tiers). `1836` ports/railways are re-tiered by
  `convert_history` like any split industry.
- **Secondary-PM gates (`unlocking_production_methods`).** A few vanilla secondary PMs are gated behind a
  main PM: `pm_bone_china` (glass porcelain), `pm_elastics` (textile luxury), `pm_precision_tools`
  (furniture luxury) each have `unlocking_production_methods = { <vanilla main PM> }` — only available when
  that main PM is present in the building. Splitting each main PM into its own renamed building broke the
  gate (the secondary silently locked). Fix: the builder **whole-file-replaces `common/production_methods/01_industry.txt`**
  and, for every `unlocking_production_methods` list, **appends our tier `pm_key`** for each split
  vanilla main PM it references (map: `vanilla_pm`→`pm_key`). The secondary then unlocks at exactly the
  tiers whose main PM satisfied it in vanilla (e.g. bone china at glass T3/T4). Everything else in the file
  is copied verbatim; the linter reads vanilla's copy + our `zzz`, so it's untouched. New gated secondaries
  a patch adds are picked up automatically on rebuild.
- **Balance UI (for Claude-less iteration):** one-click **`balance-ui.cmd`** (or
  `powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File tools\ui.ps1`) opens a browser editor (`ui/builder.html`)
  showing every building × tier with editable **main-PM** input/output volumes + an editable **wages %** line
  (per-tier `wage_pct`, default 33% of input-goods cost). **Wages sit fenced off at the bottom of the Input cell**
  (a dashed "modelling only · not emitted" divider + a tinted `.wagerow`): wages are a **model-only** term in the
  BE/profit math, **never emitted** to the game (V3 pays wages from employment) — the styling makes that explicit
  so the % field doesn't read as an emittable good. Each tier's **secondary-PM selectors** sit under the
  building name (Building column); switching one distributes that PM's effects across the columns: its input goods
  appear as extra rows in the **Input** column, its output goods (including negative *reductions* of the main good,
  e.g. tank production −20 automobiles) as extra rows in the **Output** column, and its employment folds into
  **Workforce**. The secondary **goods rows are editable** (marked with a `↳`), wired to the shared `pm_goods`
  override — so editing one changes that PM's recipe everywhere it's used (negatives allowed, for reduction
  outputs). Contributions are **not summed** with the main good — each active secondary is its own row (you see
  `automobiles 30` and `↳ automobiles −20` side by side, both editable but independent). **Non-goods outputs**
  (infrastructure / ship construction / pollution from the config, plus modifiers from active secondaries) are
  listed at the bottom of the Output cell **read-only**, **merged by kind into a total** (base pollution + an
  automation PM's pollution ⇒ one `pollution +25`). A **Workforce** column shows each tier's employment (total + per-profession),
  **tracking the selected PMs** (e.g. automation's −1500 laborers) — **viz-only**: not editable, not saved, not a
  new emit path (the builder already emits base `employment`; the UI carries it through and adds **every** secondary
  PMG's active PM employment — *including its base/default PM*, since each PMG always has one active PM in-game.
  Usually the base is inert, but some carry the jobs, e.g. the art academy's ownership PMG employs academics/
  clerks/laborers even at its default). Reference-explorer buildings get the same read-only workforce line. Live
  **full** break-even + per-good-threshold **full
  profitability** ((output − inputs − wages)/(inputs + wages)), an editable **Build cost** column
  (construction points → `required_construction`, with a muted "model N" hint that turns amber when the
  stored value diverges from what `solve_building_cost.ps1` would set), a read-only **Payback** column
  (years = build cost × £720/point ÷ annual net profit at the current price panel; wages per the row's
  wage %, at base input cost; **∞** when unprofitable at current prices), a
  break-even-ladder chart, config-part save/load (version-tolerant), and snapshot history. **Payback
  tools** (selectable X years) come in two actions at three levels: **$ = set build cost** (fix prices,
  set build cost so payback = X) and **% = set prices** (fix build cost, scale that industry's output +
  input prices by one factor — keeping the IO ratio + input mix — so an anchor tier's payback = X; flags
  prices leaving the 25–175% band). The three levels: **tier** (the `$`/`%` buttons on each row, anchor =
  that tier), **group/vanilla-industry** (the `group $→X`/`group %→X` buttons in each card header, anchor
  = the group's Tier-1), and **whole sheet** (the `sheet …` toolbar buttons — every group, anchor = each
  group's Tier-1). **Group locks:** each card header has a 🔒 lock toggle (plus toolbar `🔒 all` / `🔓
  all`); a locked group is **excluded from every mass editor** — the **Restore-defaults** preset, the sheet
  payback buttons, and its own group/tier payback buttons (which grey out) — while manual field edits stay
  allowed. Locks are UI-session state (reset on reload). The **Restore defaults** button resets each in-scope
  **unlocked** group to its as-loaded config values (target BE, volumes, build cost, ai_value, secondary PMs)
  — i.e. what a page refresh produces, but honoring current locks (a page refresh restores all defaults **and**
  lockedness). The **Bring to vanilla** button (same scope selector + lock honoring) resets each in-scope
  **unlocked** split building *toward base-game values*: every tier's output+inputs become its `vanilla_pm`'s
  recipe (read live from `vanilla.js`), its `ai_value` becomes the **pre-split vanilla building's** value
  (Tier-1 key = the vanilla base building; blank = engine default, e.g. tooling → 2000), its **`building_cost`**
  becomes the pre-split building's flat `required_construction` (the vanilla `construction_cost_*` script value:
  low 200 / medium 400 / high 600 / very_high 800 — `VANILLA_CONSTRUCTION` in the UI, mirror
  `common/script_values/building_values.txt`), and its secondaries reset to base. `target_be` is left as-is, so
  BE then reflects vanilla economics (usually off-target/amber — expected).
  **GUIDELINE — what "Bring to vanilla" must (not) touch:** it brings **everything** back to vanilla **except**
  (1) the *tier split itself* (the per-tier buildings that replaced one vanilla building stay split — this
  button is about values, not structure), and (2) any field the UI does **not** yet make editable **and**
  emittable (today: **workforce**/`employment`). Everything else that is editable+emittable — output, inputs,
  `ai_value`, `building_cost`, secondary-PM goods — must reset to the base-game value. Uphold this as we add
  fields: when a field becomes editable+emittable, wire it into Bring-to-vanilla too. *(Future: give every
  building a "vanilla root" — the recorded base-game values — so any building, not just the tier-split ones,
  can be brought to vanilla.)* More named presets will come later. **Base `ai_value`**
  (building AI construction desire) is editable everywhere: on **our tier rows** (per-tier `ai_value` in the
  config; blank = engine default 1000) and on **every explorer building** (a `data-refaiv` field backed by
  the top-level **`building_ai_value`** map). The builder emits ai_value for buildings in files it owns —
  our tiers, and PRESERVED buildings in `01/06/11` via `building_ai_value` + `Set-BuildingAiValue` (used to
  set **trade center = 3000**, 3× the vanilla default, and **tooling = 2000** at all tiers, matching
  vanilla); explorer edits to non-owned buildings show but don't emit yet. The UI's default display reads
  each building's vanilla `ai_value` from `vanilla.js` (now extracted). **"Build now"** writes the config and runs the full build (needs the `ui.ps1` server — a
  browser can't run programs). Everything else works **frontend-only**: opening `ui/builder.html`
  directly still edits + previews + **Export mod_config.json** (then run `build.ps1` yourself).
  User-facing setup lives in `README.md`.
- **All-buildings explorer + `include_all_buildings`.** The UI **always** shows every vanilla building,
  not just our tiered industries: our industries stay editable cards (each tier's **secondary PMGs** —
  canning, luxury, automation, … — are PM dropdowns under the building name; a non-base selection folds into
  that tier's BE/profit + Workforce and its **goods are editable** (via `pm_goods`) in the Input/Output columns,
  matching the linter's building-level view; default = base/"off" PM, so nothing moves until you switch). Below
  them, **every other vanilla building** (those not on our tier ladder — some economic, just out of scope
  for now) renders in the **same card + table UI** as our industries: one **category card** per taxonomy
  group, one **row per building** using the **exact same 11-column layout** as the industry tables (shared
  `MTABLE_COLS` colgroup, so columns line up). Each building is shown as **Tier 0** (untiered — a grey `0`
  pill); the ladder-only columns (Target / Build cost / Payback / →X) show **—**. Each row has the
  building's **PM selectors under its name**, **every good editable** in the Input/Output columns (wired to
  `pm_goods`), non-goods outputs (infrastructure, pollution, bureaucracy, trade capacity, ship construction,
  …) and **workforce** read-only, and informational **BE** + **Profit@thr**. **Each category is locked by default** (a
  🔒 that excludes it from future mass tools — still fully editable; the amber bar without the dimming);
  unlock to include it. **Goods edits are config-backed and emitted**: they persist to the top-level
  **`pm_goods`** map, which the builder writes into the owned production-methods files, so an edit to a PM
  applies to **every** building that uses it (our tier main PMs stay per-tier; every *other* PM — reference
  buildings' PMs *and* our tiers' secondary PMs, editable both in the reference table and on the tier cards
  (the `↳` rows) — goes through `pm_goods`). Note **PM names are not all `pm_`-prefixed** (plantations/mines
  use `default_`/`automatic_`/`picks_and_shovels_`/… ); the extractor, the builder's `pm_goods` writer, and
  the linter all handle any name — so plantation/mine goods are editable & emittable too. Buildings are
  sorted into a **custom taxonomy** (not raw `building_group`): one unified `#reference` explorer clustered
  **Utilities, trade & arts** → **Food & agriculture (arable land)** → **Raw resource extraction** (mining,
  gold fields, logging, oil, rubber) → **Other** (military consumers, property owners, administration,
  fishing & whaling, subsistence, service, construction, Unique buildings). (`#econref` is now emptied and
  merged into `#reference`.) The map is `GRPCAT`/`CATLABEL`/`ECON_CATS`/`REF_CLUSTERS` in `ui/builder.html`
  (keyed by vanilla `building_group`; unmapped groups fall back to their own card in the Other cluster).
  All PM data comes from `ui/vanilla.js` (regenerated every build by `extract_vanilla.ps1`; UI-only, never
  shipped). PM *selections* in the explorer are session-only (which PM is active is the game's runtime
  choice); PM *goods* edits are saved/emitted via `pm_goods` (above); category **locks** are UI-session state.
  **`include_all_buildings`** is a **builder** flag (top-level bool in `mod_config.json`, default `false`;
  `build.ps1 -IncludeAllBuildings` forces it on) — it is the **emission scope** for the untouched
  buildings (whether they'd reach an exported config / the built mod), **not** a UI visibility switch. The
  headless builder reads it (logs the mode); the UI only preserves it on export. We do **not** tier or edit
  those buildings yet, so today the flag has nothing extra to emit — it's the gate for when we do.
- **Localization is generated for all 11 languages** — every added key gets an English stub in
  every language file, because untranslated keys show as raw `<key>` placeholders for non-English
  players (no reliable English fallback). This is handled by the builder; you never write loc by
  hand. See MODDING_NOTES.md → Localization. In-game building names are auto-formatted as
  `Tier N. <name>. BE target <actual on-build full BE>%` (e.g. "Tier 1. Bakery Food Industries. BE target 140%";
  BE here is the wage-inclusive full break-even).
- **After an in-game load, check `error.log`** (see MODDING_NOTES.md) — the linter checks
  economics, not engine errors. The builder also emits a **self-diagnostic** on_action
  (`mod/common/on_actions/zzz_pm_rehaul_diag.txt`) that logs a `PM_TECH_REHAUL: init OK … (build <ts>)`
  marker to `logs/debug.log` at game start (absent marker ⇒ mod failed to load). **Convention:** when a
  change might trip something the linter can't see, add an invariant tripwire inside `pm_tech_rehaul_diag`
  (logs `PM_TECH_REHAUL WARN …` on failure), then have the user run the game (init fires at the 1836 start;
  ~1 in-game day, or to 01.02.1837 for a first pulse) and read back `debug.log` + `error.log`. See
  MODDING_NOTES → Self-diagnostics.
- Read `MODDING_NOTES.md` before touching metadata, load order, or icons.
- The only hand-maintained file inside `mod/` is `.metadata/metadata.json` — and even there the
  builder suffixes the mod `name` with `(built yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm)` each build (stripping the prior
  suffix so it never accumulates), so the Paradox launcher's mod list makes the freshest build
  obvious. The mod `id` stays fixed, so playset membership is unaffected.

## Deployment / testing

`build.ps1` deploys a **real copy** of `<repo>\mod` to
`Documents\Paradox Interactive\Victoria 3\mod\pm_tech_rehaul` (via `robocopy /MIR`) at the end of
every build. A directory **junction does NOT work** — the Paradox launcher won't traverse it and
shows the mod as ~48 bytes; a real copy is required. Pass `-NoDeploy` to skip. After a build,
restart the Paradox launcher if it was open (it only rescans local mods on startup), then add
"PM and Tech Rehaul" to a playset to load it.
